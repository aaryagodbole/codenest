      "The interview process was thorough and challenging. Started with a phone screen focusing on data structures, followed by multiple onsite rounds covering algorithms, system design, and behavioral questions. The interviewers were very professional and gave hints when I was stuck. Key advice: practice system design extensively and be ready to explain your thought process clearly. The coding questions were medium to hard level, mostly involving trees and dynamic programming.",

      "Great experience overall. The interviewers were friendly and the questions were fair. Heavy focus on problem-solving and coding skills with some system design discussions. Had 4 rounds total - 2 coding rounds, 1 system design, and 1 behavioral. The coding questions were well-balanced and tested different aspects of programming. Make sure to communicate your approach before diving into code.",

Unfortunately didn't make it past the final round due to a system design question I couldn't complete in time. Advice: Study Amazon's Leadership Principles thoroughly and practice system design under time pressure.",

The behavioral rounds were particularly important and they really dig deep into past experiences. Technical rounds included coding problems focused on algorithms and data structures, plus a system design round for scalability challenges.",
